      <h1>McLuhan's Ditto Device</h1>
      <p class="quote">"Printing, a ditto device confirmed and
        extended the new visual stress. It provided the
        first uniformly repeatable "commodity," the first assembly line—mass production.
        It created the portable book, which men could read
        in privacy and in isolation from others. Man could
        now inspire—and conspire.
        Like easel painting, the printed book added much
        to the new cult of individualism. The private, fixed
        point of view became possible and literacy conferred the 
        power of detachment, non-involvement."</p>
