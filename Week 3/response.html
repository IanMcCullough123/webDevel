                    <p><b>Ways of Seeing - A Video by John Berger, Ep. 1 (1972)</b></p>
                    <p>In John Berger's "Ways of Seeing" video, he shows how art and images have been shaped by culture and context throughout 
                        history. Berger challenges the traditional notion of art appreciation, asserting 
                        that the way we perceive visual imagery is heavily influenced by societal 
                        norms and the presence of the viewer. By dissecting the role of things like 
                        advertising and oil paintings, he exposes the hidden layers of 
                        meaning embedded in visual culture. Berger's insights remind us that our understanding 
                        of art is not merely passive, but rather an active process deeply intertwined with the 
                        world around us, urging viewers to critically examine the ways in which they see and 
                        engage with the visual world.</p>
